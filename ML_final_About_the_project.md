# **1\. What This Project Is About**

The dataset **ds004504** is a *large clinical EEG dataset* collected to study **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)** and **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)** using **scalp EEG recordings**.

The project’s goals are:

### **✔ Differential diagnosis using EEG**

* Distinguish **AD vs FTD vs Healthy Subjects**

* These diseases show **different brain electrical patterns**, detectable in EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta).

### **✔ Build ML models to detect dementia using EEG**

The cited research works include:

* A dataset descriptor publication (2023)

* A deep learning model **DICE-Net** (2023) designed to classify Alzheimer's using EEG signals.

### **✔ Make the data public via BIDS format**

BIDS \= Brain Imaging Data Structure → a standardized way of organizing neuroimaging data.

# **✅ What is EEG?**

**EEG (Electroencephalography)** is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain’s electrical activity using small sensors (electrodes) placed on the scalp.  
 It measures tiny voltage changes generated by large groups of brain cells (neurons). These signals help doctors and researchers study brain function, diagnose neurological disorders, and analyze patterns such as brain-wave frequencies (alpha, beta, theta, delta).

EEG is especially useful for conditions like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, sleep disorders, and brain-function research because it shows how the brain behaves in real time.

### **1\. What the Project / Dataset Is**

This dataset contains **resting-state EEG recordings** collected from three groups of participants:

* Individuals diagnosed with **Alzheimer’s disease (AD)**

* Individuals diagnosed with **Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**

* **Healthy, age-matched control** participants without neurological disorders

The recordings were collected by a clinical research team in Greece. The goal was to capture high-quality EEG signals while participants rested with their **eyes closed**, allowing researchers to analyze baseline brain activity across different forms of dementia.

The dataset was created to support:

* The discovery of **EEG-based biomarkers**

* Comparison of brain-wave patterns across AD, FTD, and healthy individuals

* Machine-learning, neuroscience, and signal-processing research

It is hosted on **OpenNeuro**, a public repository for neuroimaging data, and follows the **BIDS** (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard to ensure easy reuse, consistency, and compatibility with analysis tools.

## **1\. What the project / dataset *is***

* The dataset is titled something like: **“A dataset of EEG recordings from: Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia and Healthy subjects”.** [openneuro.org+2MDPI+2](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.2/file-display/CHANGES?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* It was collected by a clinical/academic team (in Greece) to provide resting‐state EEG (electroencephalography) recordings from three groups of participants:

  1. Patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

  2. Patients diagnosed with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)

  3. Healthy (age‐matched) control subjects (HC) or “normal” participants without these dementias.  
      [MDPI+2openneuro.org+2](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Purpose: to enable research into EEG‐based biomarkers for these neurodegenerative disorders, to compare EEG properties across the groups, and to support machine‐learning / signal‐analysis research. [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Hosted at OpenNeuro, which is an open-data repository for neuroimaging and electrophysiology (EEG/MEG) in BIDS‐compliant format. [openneuro.org+1](https://openneuro.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So, in short: this is a *public, open EEG dataset* capturing resting‐state (eyes closed) brain‐electrical activity in Alzheimer’s, FTD, and healthy controls, arranged for reuse.

## **2\. What the dataset *contains* (components)**

Let’s go into the components of the dataset: what files/folders/data variables you will find, how they’re organised, and what each part means.

### **2.1 Structure & format**

* The dataset is arranged in **BIDS format** (Brain Imaging Data Structure) which is a community standard for neuroimaging/electrophysiology data (makes reuse and tool‐compatibility easier). [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Typical folder/filename layout for each subject (participant) will likely include:

  * A `sub-<subjectID>` folder for each participant.

  * Within that folder, perhaps `ses‐<session>` if multiple sessions (here likely only one), then an `eeg` folder for EEG files.

  * Metadata files in JSON format specifying acquisition parameters, subject info (age, group), electrode montage, etc.

  * Raw EEG data files (likely .edf, .set or equivalent) plus maybe preprocessed files.

  * A `participants.tsv` file at root listing subjects, group, age, diagnosis, etc.

  * Possibly event files (though resting state may not have events).

* According to the MDPI Data paper describing this dataset: they include **raw and preprocessed EEG** signals. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Key acquisition details:

  * 19 scalp electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2) plus 2 reference electrodes. [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * Sampling rate: 500 Hz. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * Eyes‐closed resting state. [openneuro.org+1](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * Approximate durations: \~13.5 min for AD group, \~12 min for FTD, \~13.8 min for controls. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **2.2 Participant/demographic data**

* Number of participants: In one description: 88 subjects in total (36 AD, 23 FTD, 29 healthy controls). [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (some versions list 35 AD etc).

* Age: Mean age in AD \~66.4 years (SD \~7.9), FTD \~63.6 yrs (SD \~8.2), controls \~67.9 yrs (SD \~5.4). [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Cognitive assessment: Subjects had a Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (controls \~30, AD \~17.75 (SD \~4.5), FTD \~22.17 (SD \~8.22)). [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Duration of disease (for patients) in months median \~25 (IQR \~24-28.5) for the AD group. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **2.3 EEG data / signal data**

* Raw EEG time‐series data for each subject.

* Preprocessed EEG data (cleaned of artifacts, etc) in some cases. According to the MDPI paper, artifact subspace reconstruction and independent component analysis (ICA) were used for denoising. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Metadata about electrode montage, sampling rate, channel labels, recording duration.

* Possibly power‐spectrum or derived features may be included or left to user to compute. (The dataset itself probably gives raw/preprocessed signals; analysis of e.g. power spectra is done in downstream research.)

* Groups labelled: AD / FTD / Control.

### **2.4 Diagnostic / clinical labels**

* For each subject you’ll have a diagnostic label: AD, FTD, or Healthy Control.

* Possibly further metadata: age, sex/gender, MMSE score, possibly disease duration.

* Electrode channel labels and perhaps recording conditions (eyes closed, rest).

* As per BIDS, JSON sidecar files will encode acquisition parameters.

---

## **3\. Meaning of the components (so you can interpret)**

To work effectively with this dataset (especially for building machine learning or signal‐processing pipelines) you should understand what each of the components *mean*, what the key terms are. Here are the major terms/components and their meanings:

### **3.1 EEG (Electroencephalography)**

* EEG is a method of recording electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. It reflects the collective synaptic activity (mainly postsynaptic potentials) of large populations of neurons.

* In this dataset it is resting‐state, eyes closed: subjects are lying (or sitting) quietly with eyes closed and no task being performed; this gives a baseline “brain rhythm” measure.

* The 19 electrodes follow the “10–20 international system” for scalp EEG. So Fp1, Fp2, F7 etc denote specific scalp locations.

* Sampling rate 500 Hz means the EEG signal is sampled (digitised) 500 times per second; so frequency analyses up to e.g. \~250 Hz (nyquist) are possible (though brain rhythms of interest often \< 50 Hz).

* Preprocessing steps (filtering, artifact removal, ICA) are needed because EEG is noisy (eye blinks, muscle activity, line noise). The cleaned/preprocessed data support more reliable analyses.

### **3.2 BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)**

* BIDS is a standard for organising neuroimaging data (MRI, EEG, MEG) so that file/folder names and metadata are consistent. Using BIDS means easier interoperability with analysis tools.

* In this dataset, raw and/or preprocessed EEG data are BIDS‐compliant. So you’ll find standard file names like `sub-01_ses-01_task-rest_eeg.set` (or similar) and sidecar `…_eeg.json` with metadata.

* Participants metadata in `participants.tsv`, giving e.g. age, sex, group.

### **3.3 Diagnostic groups: Alzheimer’s disease & Frontotemporal dementia**

* **Alzheimer’s disease (AD):** The most common form of dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by memory loss (especially short‐term memory), eventual impairment of language/orientation/self‐care. Neuropathologically associated with amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (tau), brain atrophy (especially hippocampus and cortex), and changes in network connectivity. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Frontotemporal dementia (FTD):** A group of neurodegenerative disorders primarily affecting frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain, often with behavioural/personality changes or language impairment (depending on subtype) rather than primarily memory loss. FTD is less common than AD. [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Healthy Control (HC):** Subjects without neurological diagnosis of dementia; serve as baseline/reference group.

### **3.4 Key EEG‐analysis terms that appear in research using this dataset**

Since you may build ML/AI pipelines on this data, knowing these terms helps:

* **Power spectrum / spectral analysis:** EEG signals can be decomposed into frequency components (e.g., delta \<4 Hz, theta \~4-8 Hz, alpha \~8-12/13 Hz, beta \~13-30 Hz, gamma \>30 Hz). Many studies on dementia look for changes in these bands. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Alpha/theta‐ratio:** Ratio of power in the alpha band vs power in theta band; in this dataset, controls had significantly higher alpha/theta ratio than AD or FTD. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Aperiodic / periodic components of spectrum:** Some recent analyses decompose EEG spectra into (i) “aperiodic” (1/f like) background activity, and (ii) “periodic” oscillatory peaks. One study referenced this dataset and used such decomposition. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Permutation entropy (PeEn), spectral entropy (SpEn):** Measures of complexity or randomness of EEG signals; used to assess brain function in disease vs healthy. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Spectral edge frequency (SEF):** The frequency below which a certain percentage of total power is contained (for example 95 %); used as a summary measure of EEG spectral distribution. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Montage (electrode arrangement):** The set and arrangement of electrodes; in this dataset 19 scalp electrodes plus two reference electrodes are used. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **3.5 Medical/clinical evaluation terms**

* **Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE):** A widely used cognitive screening tool; scores range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating more severe cognitive impairment. The dataset includes MMSE scores for participants. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Disease duration (months):** How long the diagnosis has been present or symptoms recognized; for AD group median \~25 months. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Diagnosis criteria:** For AD and FTD, standardized clinical criteria were used (DSM III–R, DSM IV, ICD-10, NINCDS-ADRDA for AD) to ensure correct classification. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **4\. How this dataset *can be used* & key potential analyses**

Since you are doing AI/ML work, especially in a platform that may involve real-time signals (you mentioned WebSocket/WebRTC, autofill/resume generation, etc), here’s how this dataset might be leveraged and what you should focus on.

### **4.1 Possible uses**

* Build classification models: e.g., classify EEG recordings into AD vs Healthy, or FTD vs Healthy, or AD vs FTD. The dataset has labels for the three groups.

* Feature‐extraction and biomarker discovery: e.g., compute band‐powers (theta, alpha, beta), complexity measures (entropy), connectivity (coherence), etc and investigate differences across groups.

* Explore EEG signal changes associated with neurodegenerative disease: e.g., slowing of rhythms (increase in theta/delta, decrease in alpha); changes in complexity; disrupted connectivity.

* Develop / test preprocessing pipelines: Because raw and preprocessed signals are included, you can compare effect of preprocessing (ICA, artifact removal) on downstream classification.

* Use the dataset as a benchmark for ML/AI methods in neurodegenerative disease EEG.

### **4.2 Things to watch / key considerations**

* **Balanced groups / sample size**: The groups are somewhat unequal (e.g., 36 AD, 23 FTD, 29 controls). This affects how you design classification (e.g., stratification, cross‐validation).

* **Data quality / artefacts**: EEG has strong noise sources; preprocessing quality will matter. The dataset includes preprocessed data but you may need customised cleaning for your method.

* **Resting‐state vs task‐based**: This is resting‐state eyes closed; there’s no task events. That simplifies some aspects (no event‐related potentials) but also limits certain analyses (no stimulus‐related responses).

* **Domain differences / diagnosis confounds**: Age, sex, disease duration, medication status can affect EEG. Make sure to control for age/sex or other covariates if modelled.

* **Feature‐engineering choices**: Many prior papers (including one on this dataset) show that features like alpha/theta ratio, spectral slowing, spectral edge, entropy are discriminative. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Use of standard format (BIDS)**: Familiarise yourself with BIDS for EEG and ensure correct parsing of metadata, channels, sample rate, montage. This will streamline your pipeline.

## **5\. Medical/Neuroscientific Context — what you *need to know***

Since you asked for “disease ... each medical understanding and terms I have to have to understand the process and datasets”, here is a breakdown of the relevant medical/neuroscience background.

### **5.1 Dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD)**

* **Dementia**: A clinical syndrome characterised by a decline in cognitive function associated with damage or disease in the brain beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. Memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement may be impaired.

* Alzheimer’s disease: The most common cause of dementia (\~60-80 % of cases) in older adults. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com) It is progressive and neurodegenerative.

* Neuropathology: Key features include extracellular amyloid-β plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (tau protein), synaptic dysfunction, neuron loss, and brain atrophy (especially hippocampus, cortex).

* Clinical features: Initially mild memory loss, particularly short‐term memory, then decline in other cognitive functions (language, reasoning, orientation). Behavioural changes, impaired self‐care, eventually severe disability. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* EEG in AD: Historically, EEG in AD often shows “slowing” — i.e., increased power in slower bands (theta, delta), decreased alpha/beta, reduced alpha/theta ratio, reduced peak alpha frequency. The dataset’s associated research found such differences. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **5.2 Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**

* FTD is a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the frontal lobes and/or temporal lobes of the brain (hence “fronto-temporal”).

* It often presents earlier in age (compared to typical AD), and the initial symptoms may involve changes in behaviour/personality (behavioural variant FTD) or language (primary progressive aphasia variants) rather than memory loss. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* EEG in FTD: FTD may show different EEG patterns (sometimes less pronounced slowing than AD, but other network/connectivity changes). In the dataset’s associated analysis, FTD had specific EEG feature differences compared to controls and AD. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **5.3 Cognitive screening – MMSE**

* The Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function. It assesses orientation to time/space, immediate recall, short‐term memory, language, and attention. Scores range 0–30; normal often \~27-30; lower scores indicate cognitive impairment.

* In this dataset, controls had around 30, AD \~17.8, FTD \~22.2 on average. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **5.4 EEG rhythms & brain‐wave frequency bands**

* **Delta** (\<4 Hz) – often dominant during deep sleep; increased delta in waking state can indicate pathology.

* **Theta** (\~4-8 Hz) – often seen in drowsiness, early sleep; increased theta in waking state may indicate dysfunction or cognitive decline.

* **Alpha** (\~8-12 Hz, sometimes up to \~13 Hz) – prominent in awake, relaxed, eyes‐closed state especially in posterior regions; reductions in alpha power or peak alpha frequency are often markers of brain ageing/dysfunction.

* **Beta** (\~13-30 Hz) – associated with active thinking, attention; changes can reflect cortical dysfunction.

* **Gamma** (\>30 Hz) – high‐frequency oscillations, harder to measure cleanly, sometimes linked to cognition/attention.

* In AD/FTD research, one often sees **slowing**: reduced alpha, increased theta/delta, shift of spectral distribution to lower frequencies, lowered alpha/theta ratio. The dataset’s associated study reported controls had alpha/theta ratio \~2.62 while AD \~0.55 etc. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **5.5 Other EEG‐derived measures you should understand**

* **Entropy (Permutation Entropy, Spectral Entropy):** These measure the complexity or unpredictability of the EEG signal. Lower complexity may correspond to less healthy brain dynamics. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF):** The frequency below which a specified percentile (often 95 %) of the total power is located. In slowing conditions, SEF tends to be lower. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Aperiodic (1/f) / periodic oscillations decomposition:** Recent EEG work decomposes EEG spectra into a “background” aperiodic (1/f) component and distinct oscillatory peaks (periodic). Differences in the aperiodic slope or offset may reflect global network changes in disease. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **5.6 Why EEG might help in AD/FTD**

* EEG is **non‐invasive, relatively low cost**, can be repeated frequently, and captures brain functional dynamics (temporal resolution high).

* In neurodegeneration, changes in network connectivity and synaptic function can manifest as altered EEG rhythms or complexity. Thus EEG may provide *biomarkers* for early detection, monitoring progression, or classification of dementia types. The dataset aims to facilitate this. [MDPI+1](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/6/95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* For machine‐learning/AI work: The dataset provides labelled data in a standard format, so one can try to extract features and build models that distinguish AD vs HC vs FTD.

## **6\. Summary for your use (as AI intern)**

Since you are working on AI and real‐time features (WebSocket/WebRTC) at GoCrackIT, here’s how you might leverage this dataset and what to note:

* **Data access**: Download the dataset from OpenNeuro (version 1.0.7). Ensure you look at the folder structure, participants metadata, EEG files.

* **Preprocessing pipeline**: Because you’re building AI, ensure consistent preprocessing: filtering, removing bad channels, ICA or artifact removal, epoching (though resting‐state may not need epoching), computing features (band powers, ratios, entropy, etc). The dataset already gives preprocessed data in some versions, but you may want to implement your own to align with your platform.

* **Feature engineering**: For classification, good starting features: relative power in each band (delta, theta, alpha, beta), alpha/theta ratio, peak frequency of alpha, SEF, entropy measures, maybe connectivity/coherence.

* **Labels and groups**: Make sure each subject has a label (AD, FTD, HC) plus covariates (age, sex, MMSE) so you can adjust for confounds.

* **Modeling**: Try classification models (SVM, RandomForest, Neural Nets, CNNs on spectrograms) comparing groups. Consider cross‐validation, stratification by group.

* **Interpretability**: Because this is biomedical, being able to interpret feature importance (which bands, which electrodes matter) will help. For example, prior work found alpha/theta ratio differences and prefrontal electrode differences. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259140/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Integration into your platform**: Although your internship work is autofill/resume generation and real‐time, you might use this dataset as a base for augmenting or simulating neuro‐adaptive features, or as an example of structured data ingestion. Maybe you build a module for neurological EEG biomarker classification.

* **Ethical/clinical caution**: Even though the data are public and anonymised, when dealing with AI in medical/neuroscience, you must consider generalisability, biases (age, sex, disease duration), potential over‐fitting, and translational validity (EEG at rest for research vs clinical diagnostic utility).

---

## **7\. Final checklist of terms you should be comfortable with**

Here is a compact list of terms you should make sure you understand:

* EEG, electrodes, scalp montage (10-20 system)

* Resting‐state vs task EEG

* Frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma

* Band power, relative power (power in band / total power)

* Alpha/theta ratio

* Peak alpha frequency

* Spectral edge frequency (SEF)

* Aperiodic vs periodic spectral components; 1/f “background”

* Complexity measures: Permutation Entropy, Spectral Entropy

* ICA (Independent Component Analysis) for EEG preprocessing

* BIDS format: subject/session folders, sidecar JSON, participants.tsv

* Dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia – clinical features, neuropathology

* MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) score

* Machine learning/AI classification: feature extraction, labels, cross‐validation, interpretability

## **Per-subject folders `sub-<ID>/eeg/` containing:**

### **1\. EEG raw data files — common extensions:**

* **`.edf`** (European Data Format) — widely used for EEG. Holds continuous multichannel waveform data and some annotations/metadata.

* **`.vhdr` \+ .eeg \+ .vmrk\`** (BrainVision format) — three-file format used by some labs.

* **`.fif`** (MNE) — less common in raw datasets but sometimes present.  
   **What they hold:** raw voltage time series for each channel at a sampling rate (e.g. 250, 500, 1k Hz).  
   **Why important:** this is the primary signal you'll analyze.  
   **How to read:**

* **Python recommendations:** [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools) (high-level, BIDS support), `pyedflib` (EDF), `mne.io.read_raw_edf()`:

`import mne`  
`raw = mne.io.read_raw_edf('sub-01_task-rest_eeg.edf', preload=True)`

### **2\. `*_eeg.json` (BIDS sidecar)**

**Contains:** recording parameters — sampling frequency, EEG reference, powerline frequency (50/60 Hz), manufacturer, tasks, filters used.  
 **Why important:** tells you how data was acquired and what preprocessing (if any) was applied. Must check before filtering or notch-filtering.  
 **How to read:**

`import json`  
`with open('sub-01_task-rest_eeg.json') as f:`  
    `j = json.load(f)`  
`print(j['SamplingFrequency'])`

### **3\. `channels.tsv`**

**Contains:** list of channel names, types (`EEG`, `EOG`, `ECG`, `MISC`), status (good/bad), units, and coordinate labels if present.  
 **Why important:** you need to know which channels are EEG vs EOG (eye channels) for artifact removal, and to know which channels to include.  
 **How to read:** `pandas.read_csv('channels.tsv', sep='\t')`

### **4\. `electrodes.tsv` or `coordsystem.json` (optional)**

**Contains:** electrode coordinates (for source work / topographies). Not always present with clinical EEG; if present, enables topographic plots and source localization.

---

## **`derivatives/` (optional)**

**Contains:** processed outputs (e.g., ICA results, cleaned EEG, epoch files, feature tables). Not always present.  
 **Why important:** if present, can save time — but you must check how they were generated to avoid circularity or leakage when building your own models.  
 **How to use:** inspect the `derivatives/README` or sidecar JSON to understand processing steps.

---

# **4\) File extensions and what they store**

* **`.edf`** — EEG waveform file (multi-channel time series). Read with MNE or pyEDFlib.

* **`.vhdr`, .vmrk, .eeg\`** — BrainVision raw EEG files (header, marker, signal).

* **`.fif`** — MNE/Neuromag format (signals \+ metadata).

* **`.json`** — BIDS sidecars (recording metadata: sampling frequency, manufacturer, filters, task).

* **`.tsv`** — tabular metadata (participants.tsv, channels.tsv).

* **`.txt` / README** — dataset notes.

* **`.mat`** — occasionally used for saved processed variables (MATLAB). Not necessarily present here.

# **✅ What is Power Spectral Density (PSD)?**

**Power Spectral Density** (PSD) describes **how the power (energy)** of a signal is distributed **across different frequencies**.

For EEG, PSD tells you:

* How much **delta** (0.5–4 Hz) power the brain is producing

* How much **theta** (4–8 Hz) power

* How much **alpha** (8–13 Hz)

* How much **beta** (13–30 Hz)

* etc.

Think of PSD as converting a **time-domain EEG signal** (voltages over time) into a **frequency-domain representation** (energy over frequency).

---

# **🌟 Why PSD is VERY important in dementia EEG**

Research shows:

### **🔷 Alzheimer’s Disease:**

* **Delta ↑**

* **Theta ↑**

* **Alpha ↓**

* **Beta ↓**

* **Slowing ratio ↑** (theta+delta)/(alpha+beta)

### **🔷 Frontotemporal Dementia:**

* Less global slowing than AD

* More changes in **frontal regions**

* Different PSD patterns compared to AD

### **🔷 Healthy Controls:**

* Normal alpha peak around \~10 Hz

* Balanced theta/alpha/beta distribution

👉 PSD *directly captures* these differences.

This is why almost **all EEG dementia research uses PSD as core features**.

# **🧠 Why PSD makes sense mathematically**

EEG raw signal `x(t)` is noisy, non-stationary, and full of artifacts.

PSD converts it into a **stable frequency profile**, revealing:

* Dominant oscillations

* Disease-related spectral slowing

* Network changes

This is crucial because dementia affects **oscillatory rhythms**, not just raw voltage patterns.

---

# **📌 How PSD is computed?**

Common methods:

* **Welch’s method** (most popular): splitting into small windows, averaging Fourier transforms

* **Multitaper** method

Libraries:

`from mne.time_frequency import psd_welch`  
`psds, freqs = psd_welch(raw)`

You get:

* `freqs` \= frequency axis

* `psds` \= power at each frequency for each channel

You can then compute:

* Band power: integrate PSD over frequency band

* Relative power: band\_power / total\_power

* Ratios: theta/alpha, delta/alpha, etc.

# **🧠 Should you convert EEG → PSD before training a model?**

### **Short answer: YES — for almost all baseline ML models.**

### **Longer answer: depends on the model type.**

---

# **⭐ Which type of model benefits from PSD?**

### **1️⃣ Classical ML models (recommended for this dataset)**

* Logistic Regression

* SVM

* Random Forest

* XGBoost

* LightGBM

These models **perform MUCH better** on **frequency-domain features (PSD)** than on raw EEG.

Reason:

* They can’t exploit raw-waveform temporal relationships

* PSD reduces noise and increases discriminative features

**For dementia EEG classification, PSD features often outperform raw signal models unless using deep learning.**

---

### **2️⃣ Deep Learning Models on Raw EEG**

Use raw signals (not PSD):

* 1D-CNN

* Transformer

* RNN/LSTM

* DICE-net (from the dataset papers\!)

These models can learn spectral patterns automatically **if enough data is available**.

But **ds004504 has only 88 subjects**, so deep networks:

* Tend to overfit

* Do not generalize well

* Require heavy regularization & augmentation

Thus **PSD usually performs better than raw** for small-to-medium EEG datasets.

---

### **3️⃣ Deep Learning Models on Spectrograms / Time-Frequency Images**

Convert PSD or STFT into images:

* Spectrogram CNN

* EEGNet

* DICE-Net (architecture from paper)

This can work well **but PSD is still a key input**.

---

# **🏆 Practical recommendation for *your dataset (ds004504)***

This dataset:

* Has **only 88 subjects**

* EEG is **resting-state** (PSD is ideal)

* Disease differences are **mainly spectral (frequency)**

So the **best first approach** is:

### **✔ Step 1: Preprocess (filtering, re-reference, artifact removal)**

### **✔ Step 2: Convert each EEG recording → PSD (Welch)**

### **✔ Step 3: Compute band powers (delta, theta, alpha, beta)**

### **✔ Step 4: Aggregate features:**

* Mean band power per channel

* Global band power

* Regional (frontal/temporal/parietal) powers

* Ratios (theta/alpha, delta/alpha)

* Peak alpha frequency

### **✔ Step 5: Train ML classifiers**

You will likely see:

* 75–90% accuracy for binary AD vs Control

* 65–80% accuracy for AD vs FTD

* 90% for Control vs dementia combined

Raw EEG deep learning will usually perform **worse** unless you do heavy augmentation.

# **🎯 Final Answer**

### **✔ What is power spectral density?**

A frequency-domain representation that tells you how much power the EEG has at each frequency (0–40Hz). It reveals oscillatory patterns associated with dementia.

### **✔ Do you need to convert EEG → PSD?**

**YES**, for a high-performing and stable model — especially for your dataset size.

### **✔ Will PSD improve accuracy?**

**In almost all cases, yes.**  
 PSD \+ ML is the standard approach for EEG dementia classification.
